# Julia2925: learn a fast and intuitive programming language in two workdays. 

This course is currently under construction. All materials are work-in-progress.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/beramos/DS-Julia2925/binder_pluto_server?urlpath=pluto)

## Introduction

In case you do not want to install julia and jump straight in the course material, use binder instead. However, we do not recommend doing so since saving progress is tricky. 

## Getting started
### Installing Julia
1. Download the *Julia* binaries for your system [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/) we suggest to install the Current Stable Release v1.8.4.
2. Yes, it is that simple :zap:

### Running the notebooks
Download or clone this repository, open the Julia REPL and navigate to the folder

```julia
cd("path/to/DS-Julia2925/")
include("launch.jl")
```

This should open a browser window with the Pluto notebooks. The first time it can take a while since it is installing all the dependencies.
