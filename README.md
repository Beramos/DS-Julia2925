This course is currently under construction. All materials are work-in-progress.


## Introduction

**wip**

In case you do not want to install julia and jump straight in the course material, use **binder WIP** instead. 

## Getting started
### Installing Julia
1. Download the *Julia* binaries for your system [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/) we suggest to install the Long-term support release, v1.0.5
2. Yes, it is that simple :zap:

### First time running 
Download or clone this repository, navigate to the files and open the Julia REPL,

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```
to install the dependencies.

### Opening the noteboos
Open the Julia REPL

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")

using Pluto
Pluto.run()
```

This should open a browser window with the Pluto notebooks.
